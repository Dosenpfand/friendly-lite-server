# polite-server - Self Hosted Captcha Server, compatible with Friendly Captcha

## Motivation

FriendlyCaptcha.com offers a privacy aware captcha service.
Due to various reasons (for example very strict data protection rules) it might make sense to host the service
for puzzle and verification on your own machine.

## Subscriptions

We highly recommend to subscribe to the Friendly Captcha service to support their awesome work.

## Requirements

* PHP 7.4 or higher
* sodium support
* apcu support

## Installation

You need a web server running PHP 7.4 or later.

1. Install the public folder to the your document root.
2. Copy and adapt env.template.php to env.php 
3. Change the friendly captcha widgets endpoint to user your server
4. In your backend configuration, use the your own server endpoint and

## Endpoints

Instead of `https://api.friendlycaptcha.com/api/v1/siteverify` use `https://yourserver/siteverify.php`.
Instead of `https://(eu-)api.friendlycaptcha.eu/api/v1/puzzle"` use `https://yourserver/puzzle.php`. 

## What works

* Check of signature
* Check of puzzles
* Check of timestamps
* Replay checks
* Basic difficulty scaling

## Troubleshooting 

### The widget shows an error when loading the puzzle 

* Check your server log for errors 
* Open /puzzle.php manually and see if there are any errors displayed
* Is LibSodium available?

### Captcha is not validated, even generated by the widget itself

* This should not happen, maybe file an issue including the server logs

### Invalid Captchas are accepted (for example form submitted before captcha was solved) 

* Friendly Captcha recommends to accept Captcha solutions on server errors, so also here check for server errors
* Is APCU and LibSodium available?
